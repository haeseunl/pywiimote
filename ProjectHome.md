A library that runs on the big-3 (Windows, Mac and Linux)
and lets the developer access all facets of the wii remote via Python.  Can easily be interfaced with a GUI of your choice.

-- Note -- due to a competing library, pywiiuse, being fully featured and stable, development on this library has stalled for the foreseeable future.  I wish you all the best and good luck with your Python projects! :)
